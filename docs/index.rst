Data Waffe is a data collaborative system created to enable key population communities and activists in developing data-driven reports and advocacy campaigns.
This platform was created with the mission of amplifying the voices and experiences of these communities, whose data has historically been marginalized and ignored. 

This manual will explain how to:
   - navigate the main user interface of Wagtail;
   -  create different kinds of pages;
   -  modify, save, publish and unpublish pages;
   -  set up and manage new users 
   -  assign users to specific roles with specific permissions;
   -  upload, edit and include images and documents;
   -  add and moderate comments on articles;
   -  create and edit organisations and their information;
   -  manage the data of multiple organisations on the platform
